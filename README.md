A simple command line system to resemble the working of a bank in python using sql as the data store.

Its quite simple, start off by downloading the source code and then follow the instructions below:
1. Have python installed (since its a project built in python)
2. Install `mysql.connector` by copy pasting the below code in your cmd promt
```bash
py -m pip install mysql.connector
```
